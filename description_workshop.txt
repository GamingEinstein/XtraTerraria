Xtra Terraria is a mod which aims to improve various aspects of all points of progression throughout vanilla gameplay while also adding it's own features
Currently I plan on improving the following:
[list]
[*] Reduce overall grind of certain key areas, such as Early Hardmode
[*] Improve early game Summoner and Mage
[*] Add more incentives to biomes such as the Snow, Hallow, Ocean, and World Evils
[*] Improve Micro-Biomes like Granite, Marble, and Spider Caves
[*] Add unique structures to the Underground
[*] And more to come!
[/list]

I am also looking for people to help contribute! Join the Discord if you are interested or just want to hang around!

Thanks for reading!
