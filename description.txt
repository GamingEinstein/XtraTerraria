Xtra Terraria is a mod which aims to improve various aspects of all points of progression throughout vanilla gameplay while also adding it's own features
Currently I plan on improving the following:
= Reduce overall grind of certain key areas, such as Early Hardmode
= Improve early game Summoner and Mage
= Add more incentives to biomes such as the Snow, Hallow, Ocean, and World Evils
= Improve Micro-Biomes like Granite, Marble, and Spider Caves
= Add unique structures to the Underground
= And more to come!

I am also looking for people to help contribute! Check the Forum Thread for more information!
